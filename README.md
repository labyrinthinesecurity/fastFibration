# Fibration symmetries on Python

This is a python implementation of https://github.com/makselab/FastFibration fast fibration partitioning (FFP) algorithm

Initally, the algorithm was presented in [Morone et. al.](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8306) in 2021. In 2025, FFP was used extensively in [Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18713)

## Getting started
Run test.py to get started, then run fiber.py

The Graphs subdirectory contains:
- graphs with strongly connected components (SCC): 3 components (3SCC), 6 components (6SCC)
- graphs depicted in **Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks**: figure 1.3 page 10, figure 4.2 page 49, figure 17.5 page 358
- graph of E.Coli metabolism (test_Ecoli.txt)
